## Requirements
- **Zabbix Server** version 7.0 or higher
- **Home Assistant** with API enabled

## Setup

### 1. Import the Template
- Upload the `.yaml` file to Zabbix by navigating to **Configuration** -> **Templates** and clicking **Import**.

### 2. Adjust Macros
Modify the following macros in the template:
- `{$API.TOKEN}`: API token used for authentication with the Home Assistant API.  
  This token can be generated in the Home Assistant settings under **Profile > Token**.
- `{$HA.URL}`: The URL of the Home Assistant instance, including the protocol (e.g., `http://`) and optional port.  
  Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8123`

### 3. Link the Host
- Create a new host and link the template to it, or link the template to an existing host that represents the Home Assistant instance.
